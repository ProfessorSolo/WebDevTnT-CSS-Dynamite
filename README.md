# 💣 CSS Dynamite — Styling That Pops

Welcome to **CSS Dynamite**, a quick-hit visual demo showing how a few lines of CSS can turn a flat page into something that _pops_.  
This isn’t a build-along — it’s a **reference and inspiration piece** to spark ideas before students dive into their own styling projects.

## 💥 What It Demonstrates

- **Gradients** — linear, radial, and layered backgrounds
- **Borders** — radius tricks, outlines, and subtle contrast frames
- **Opacity & Transparency** — focus and depth without chaos
- **Shadows** — text, box, and layered effects for dimension

Each section in the page highlights one of these techniques with concise, readable code and live results.

## 🧭 Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ProfessorSolo/css-dynamite.git
cd css-dynamite
npm install
npm run dev

Then open the local server in your browser and play with the CSS — tweak, break, fix, repeat.

---

## 🧪 Try This
1. Change one gradient angle or color stop — see how perception shifts.
2. Add or remove a shadow blur — notice how it changes elevation.
3. Experiment with `opacity` or `rgba()` to manage contrast and legibility.
4. Capture a before/after screenshot for discussion.
